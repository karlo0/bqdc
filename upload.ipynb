By default the workspace file is stored in a folder with the name of the _parent_ dataset in the working directory of the module **bqdc**\n",
    "2. After loading the **bqdc** module, the connection to BigQuery and Data Catalog is established by calling `bqdc.toolbox()`.\n",
    "3. The folder of this script should contain the **bqdc.py** file and the **json** File that contains the correct **service account key**.\n",
    "4. The **first sheet** of the workspace file has the name **'metadata_of_tables'** and contains informatation of the entire table such as table description which is retrieved from tags created by the table tag template.\n",
    "5. The **field metadata** of the downloaded tables is stored in **separate sheets** of the workspace file where the name of the sheet is the name of the table.\n",
